CWO - Appointment duration is shown as 0 minutes,"*Reporter:* Daniel Lim, VCSD

*Assignee* : %Eldwin Christian%

Please see VCSD users comments in bold:

*[VCSD]: NEA user is unable to set the end time of the CWO session at the Intranet platform. This differs from the expected outcome after NEA users upload the appointment template with a specifically inputted CWO session end time.*

_[Xtremax]: The end time for the CWO session is auto-defined by the system based on the duration of the session configured._ 

_For example, if the duration per appointment +2 hours+ and the start working hours is 9 am, ePortal will auto defined the appointment slots to 9AM - 11AM, 11AM - 1PM, 1PM - 3PM, 3PM - 5PM._

*[VCSD] I am unable to edit the Appointment Duration to test this, perhaps it is an Administrator Access Right, if this is the case could you edit the Appointment Duration and test this? Can DA edit this part?*

*I note that the Appointment Duration is set at 30mins, however, the appointment is shown to last for zero minutes. i.e. 10.30am  10.30am instead of the expected 10.30am  11.00am Please rectify this.*

We raised this ticket to separate notification action in workflow from main thread
 cos currently the workflow, upon creation (triggered by eapplication submission), it will start executing the actions under the starting state, which currently are all notification actions like send email, sms. etc

and the GPC notif service is super slow.. need 50s+ to send out
 resulting in the creation request timed out
 and eApplication is not able to get its corresponding workflow process ID, and result user got error when want to view submisison detail or do any further processing

[ePortal] Golden Transaction Activity - My Payments link appearing on mobile,"*Reporter:* Ping Hwee, FD & Annicia, ITD

*Details:*

Hi Annicia,

 We noticed that there were 2 transactions made for HCMS and EEMS on 25 Nov.

How come there are transactions when ePayment in ePortal has not gone live yet?

 

Hi Xtremax,

 ePayment module in ePortal is not official launched, MOP not supposed to have access to the payment page directly.

 However it is reported there are 2 legitimate payment collected on Monday 25 Nov 2019.

 I checked the page in production. Currently, the link is only disable for desktop but not mobile mode. The My Payment option is visible and accessible in mobile mode. Shouldnt both desktop and mobile mode referring to the same set of codes?

 This case is considered *a S2 incident. Please provide us the incident report.*",2,2,2
